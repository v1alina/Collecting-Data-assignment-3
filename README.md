# Collecting-Data-assignment-3
Assignment 3 for the course collecting data.



Create a Jupyter Notebook to explore a dataset of your choice. You can use the dataset prepared for Assignment 1 or a different dataset, but in any case, please set up a new GitHub repository for this assignment.

Structure. To be completed by Thursday 7 December at 23:59. This assignment will be peer-reviewed, meaning that each student will receive the links to two other GitHub repositories and will have to write a few lines of feedback (deadline for that will be on 12 December). After that, Yevgen and TAs will also check all the repositories and provide some general feedback.

Task. There are no specific questions or tasks due to the flexible nature of the assignment. You need to come up with questions that make sense for your dataset and try to answer them by doing some data wrangling and visualisation. Some ideas of what you can explore include data distributions, their central tendencies, their shapes, outliers, correlations between variables. This list is not exhaustive, and you also don't have to look at all of these things - instead, focus on what helps you to answer your questions. Your analysis has to contain at least two questions and at least one visualisation.

If you don't know where to start, look at the examples in the textbook and YouTube videos (see the links on Brightspace, in the Week 4 Content and Materials).

Instructions.

Set up a new public GitHub repository for this assignment (do not simply add things to the repository from Assignment 1, even if you're using the same dataset).
Make sure the new repository contains:
a) a Jupyter Notebook file,
b) the data set you use,
c) a README.md file with a brief description of the data set (it can be much shorter than the one in Assignment 1) and the questions you ask while exploring the data.
Use Jupyter Notebook to carry out an exploratory data analysis. Make sure that you properly annotate your code (recall that you can use Markdown cells for writing text in Jupyter Notebook). It should be clear to peer students and to instructors what you're doing at each step and why.
