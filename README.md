# Collecting-Data-assignment-3
Assignment 3 for the course collecting data.

## Data Set:

The data, it's methodology and the structure of the questionair can be found in the folder Data Set. The data is saved in a '.sav' file, which requires an extra python library to be install before we can created a data frame with Pandas. 

The data was collected by Pew Research Center and contains the ['American Trends Panel Wave 107'](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/dataset/american-trends-panel-wave-107/).
The questionaire was answered by participants between April 25 â€“ May 1, 2022. 


## Questions:

1. The first section of the EDA looks at how the sentiments on the state of the nation correlate. The sentiments used in the questionaire are 'Fearful','Proud', 'Hopeful' and 'Angry'. They can be answered either affirmative or non-affirmative fashion. To look at the correlation of these sentiments I used a heatmap matrix, which visualise the sentiments.
2. The second section goes into the question of whether or not the participant has confidence in the state of the nation, giving participants 4 options from 'Quite a lot' to 'None at all'. I created a plot that shows the relation between the confidence in the nation and the sentiment of fearfullness of the participant. For readablity, it would be best to change the labels of the plot but that would need some more time for the project.
